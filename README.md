# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For me their were multiple problems that I was solving in this course had I dealt with. First for majority of project 1 was analyzing the project programs and determining the runtime analysis for different data structures. The second project was more solving the problem of unfinished programs that has to read file input for analysis of computer science courses. This project required techniques such as applying sorting methods and initializing new fields.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Approaching the problem required careful attention to detail and making sure that I implemented the proper algorithm to satisfy assignment needs. Data structures are important to understand because they are one of the primary concepts used when working with computer language.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Overcoming roadblocks that I encountered while going through the activities or projects required careful attention to detail and making sure that I implemented the proper algorithm to satisfy assignment needs. Utilization of resources such as the internet and help of resources provided to me helped me present my best work possible.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I find that my work expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by providing new experiences and making me visualize the projects specific structures. Viewing these structures I feel improved my computer programming skills helping me improve in my future goals. Lastly, everytime I work on a new project I feel my code and the structure of the programs improves because of my consistent education on computer language.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project evolved the way I write programs to be more maintable, readable, and adaptable. The way this happened was through my communication with my peers and teachers. My programs have become far more clear and the adaptability improved because the projects can easily apply to different scenarios in coding.
